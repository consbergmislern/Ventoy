Each zombie has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you will need to adapt your tactics accordingly. Some zombies can infect you with their bites or spit, so you will need to heal yourself or your teammates with medkits or antidotes. You can also build barricades and traps to slow down or kill the zombies.
 
Some tips for playing as a survivor are:
 
- Use stealth and cover to avoid attracting too many zombies.
- Use headshots and melee attacks to conserve ammo and kill zombies faster.
