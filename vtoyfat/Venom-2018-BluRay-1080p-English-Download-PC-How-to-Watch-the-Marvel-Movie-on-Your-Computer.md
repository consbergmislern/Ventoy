## Option 1: Download Venom from a Blu-ray Disc
  
If you have a Blu-ray disc of Venom, you can use a Blu-ray ripper software to convert it to a digital file that you can play on your PC. A Blu-ray ripper is a program that can copy the data from a Blu-ray disc and encode it into a video format that is compatible with your computer.
  
There are many Blu-ray rippers available online, but some of them may contain malware or viruses that can harm your PC. Therefore, you should only download them from trusted sources and scan them with an antivirus software before installing them.
  
One of the most popular and reliable Blu-ray rippers is MakeMKV. It is a free software that can rip any Blu-ray disc to an MKV file, which is a video format that preserves the original quality and features of the disc. You can download MakeMKV from its official website: https://www.makemkv.com/
  
Here are the steps to rip Venom from a Blu-ray disc using MakeMKV:
  
1. Insert the Venom Blu-ray disc into your PC's optical drive.
2. Launch MakeMKV and select the Venom disc from the list of sources.
3. MakeMKV will scan the disc and show you the titles and tracks that are available. You can uncheck the ones that you don't want to rip, such as trailers, extras, or foreign audio tracks.
4. Select the output folder where you want to save the MKV file.
5. Click on the "Make MKV" button and wait for the ripping process to finish.
6. Once done, you will have an MKV file of Venom in your output folder. You can play it on your PC using any media player that supports MKV files, such as VLC or MPC-HC.
